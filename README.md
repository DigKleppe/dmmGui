## Display and touch controllers

The display and touch (indev) controllers are now into it's own repository, you can find it [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl_esp32_drivers).
To report any issue or add new display or touch (indev) drivers you can do so in the `lvgl_esp32_drivers` repo.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF v4 Framework.
- LVGL soucre copied in IDF

### Note

This project tries to be compatible with both the ESP-IDF v3.x and v4.0, but using v4.0 is recommended.
Instructions assume you are using the v4.x toolchain, otherwise use the make commands, e.g. instead of running `idf.py menuconfig`, run `make menuconfig`.

### Build and run

1. Clone this project 

3. Run `idf.py menuconfig`

4. Configure LVGL in `Components config->LVGL Configuration`. For monochrome displays use the mono theme and we suggest enabling the `unscii 8` font.

5. Configure your display and/or touch controllers in `Components config->LVGL TFT Display Configuration` and `Components config->LVGL TOUCH Configuration`.

6. Store your project configuration.

7. Build the project with `idf.py build`

8. If the build don't throw any errors, flash the demo with `idf.py -p (YOUR SERIAL PORT) flash` (with `make` this is just `make flash` - in 3.x PORT is configured in `menuconfig`)
